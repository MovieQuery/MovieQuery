# Team Agreement

## Communication Plan
* We will meet each day to work individually and as a team in person.
* Concept questions will be discussed in a round table format where everyone must contribute and no single person speaks for more than a few minutes.
* Start morning at 9am with a mini sprint planning session to assign and plan daily tasks
* End each day with a mini sprint retrospective to review progress.

## Team Conflict plan
* Any type of conflict lasting more than 5 minutes or that is stopping group progress needs to be documented in the project management tool and discussed with the whole group. 
* Non-blocked conflicts can be discussed in sprint sessions
* Everyone will be open and bring up issues quickly as to not fester. If needed, grab a TA.

## Work Plan
* Tasks will be identified through our sprint planning sessions and the technical requirements set at the beginning of the project
* Team contribution will be qualified in time spent. We are all at different levels and have different skills so as long as each putting in our time, contribution will be fairly distributed.
* As technical requirements arise, we will self selection which tasks to work on. If there is a conflict, we will stop and discuss the pros and cons to the task and assign a team member based on their current skillsets.
* If the above doesnâ€™t produce and obvious choice, we will resort to random selection via drawing straws, rock-paper-scissors, etc.
* If a team member is struggling for more than 15 minutes, grab another team member and do some pair programming to work it out.
* We will establish general naming conventions at the start of our project, and if there is any conflict, it will be brought to the group.
* A task is complete when it hits MVP and has been successfully merged into development by another team member.
* If we are working in the same file, we will pair program.

## Git Process
* Merge individual branches to master throughout the day after a module has been completed and deploy to heroku only after the product is functioning normally.
* We will merge onto the master branch as we go, and work on individually named branches as we work.
* When there is a merge conflict that comes up, we will review the conflict as a group and resolve the code together to avoid further conflict.
* When there is a merge that affects the functionality of the application, we will have 2 people review the PR before merging into our master branch.
* When there is a smaller merge that does not affect the functionality of the program, we will only need one other person to review the PR.
* At morning spring planning, assign tasks and assess merge conflict potential. This can be done by creating TODO cards within the project planning board in GitHub.

## Schedules
* Evening retrospective will happen at 5pm to enable folks to catch reasonable buses.
* Lunch can be flexible time as long as it doesn't become an issue.
* We will self manage our breaks and lunches as long as it doesn't become an issue.
* We will plan to hit MVP by Wednesday afternoon and complete the debugging process by the end of the day on Thursday.
* The project will be deployed 11am and finished at 12pm on Friday.
