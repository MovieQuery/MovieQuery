### Charlie Danger - User
Charlie Danger is a young adult adult who loves to camp out in front of his television set. He is also over-critical of user ratings on movies and gets easily turned off by negative reviews. He knows that there are a lot of movies out there that are much better than their ratings, but still, those negative ratings discourage him from starting a new movie. He is a little bit lazy and ends up spending way too much time making decisions in his life--even on the little things. It causes him miss out on a lot of downtime for himself, so he is feeling like he needs some more pressure in his life.
